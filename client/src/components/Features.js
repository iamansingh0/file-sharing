              share a file, data is being transferred between your computer or
              phone and our servers, then from our servers to your friendâ€™s
              device. The cost of that data transfer is covered by your internet
              service or the data plan on your phone.

              Generous data transfer rates and file size limits ensure even big
              files can be shared expeditiously. Once you have uploaded your
              files and shared the link, you can rest easy knowing that the file
              will not linger indefinitely in the cloud. As soon as it has been
              received by the intended recipient, your file is gone forever!
